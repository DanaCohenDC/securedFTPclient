For using the FTP server and client please download:
1. mainFTPServer.exe (from folder named 'server')
2. securedFTPClient.exe (from filder named 'client')

**If you save these files in other location on your computer, please save it in different locations for each one
	for not messing server with client.


For starting FTP server just right click on mainFTPServer.exe and -> run as administrator
Now, when the server is up - double click on securedFTPClient.exe,
A new window will be opened and now you can register to the server if needed, log in and use
all server applications tranquillity.

Please notice:
If you are using the server as different clients - every client has it's own directory on the server,
and can't access other client's directory on server.
